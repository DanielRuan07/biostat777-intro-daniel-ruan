    "text": "Summary\nFrom Figure 1 we can see that teams with higher margin of victory tend to make it to the playoffs, which makes sense intuitively– higher margin of victory to an extent indicates a better W-L record. We can also see that it is very rare for teams who have a negative margin of victory to make it to the playoffs. Figure 2 suggests that most Super Bowl winners actually are not the team with the highest margin of victory that year, but it’s also rare to have team with lower-than-median margin of victory to win the Super Bowl. The attendance record shown in Figure 3 indicates that the attendance is not obviously affected by the teams’ performances in a season. Fans are more loyal than we expected! Nonetheless, the analysis regarding margin of victory did not take into account strength of schedule, which is shown to affect margin of victory.3"
