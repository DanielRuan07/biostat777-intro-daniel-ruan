I graduated from Wake Forest University in May 2023, where I studied Biochemsitry & Molecular Biology and Mathematical Statistics. I did research on computational chemistry, where I obtained some basic coding skills. However, I would like to learn more about it in a more organized manner. 

In my free time, I like to watch sports and play GeoGuessr.
