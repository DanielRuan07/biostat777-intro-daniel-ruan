## Questions

For this project, the main question is how does a team's margin of victory relate to its performance in the playoffs. Another question is how does the game attendance vary based on the team's performance each year.

## Intended Audience

The intended audience is those who are interested in football. It can also be used to provide some guidance to sports betting.

## Data Source

The data is from 2020/02/04's TidyTuesday. Here's the [link](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-04/readme.md#get-the-data-here) to the data. @noauthor_nfl_nodate

## Data Dictionary

The data dictionary can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-04/readme.md#data-dictionary).

::: {.callout-warning title="Team Name Change"}
Since the data is from 2020, the now Washington Commanders are listed as Washington Redskins. The team changed its name in 2020 after complaints "Redskins" was offensive to Native Americans. @belson_washington_2020

::: {.callout-note title="The 2007 Season"}
You might have noticed that in the 2007 season, there's a team with a margin of victory of almost 20 points (highest over the past 20 seasons for any team) but did not win the Super Bowl. Yes, the New England Patriots, who went 16-0 in the regular season, was defeated by the New York Giants 14-17 in Super Bowl XLII.

## Summary

From Figure 1 we can see that teams with higher margin of victory tend to make it to the playoffs, which makes sense intuitively-- higher margin of victory to an extent indicates a better W-L record. We can also see that it is very rare for teams who have a negative margin of victory to make it to the playoffs. Figure 2 suggests that most Super Bowl winners actually are not the team with the highest margin of victory that year, but it's also rare to have team with lower-than-median margin of victory to win the Super Bowl. The attendance record shown in Figure 3 indicates that the attendance is not obviously affected by the teams' performances in a season. Fans are more loyal than we expected! Nonetheless, the analysis regarding margin of victory did not take into account strength of schedule, which is shown to affect margin of victory. @johnson_study_2020
