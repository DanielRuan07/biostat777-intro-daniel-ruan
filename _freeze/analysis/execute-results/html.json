Another question is how does the game attendance vary based on the team's performance each year.\n\n## Intended Audience\n\nThe intended audience is those who are interested in football. It can also be used to provide some guidance to sports betting.\n\n## Data Source\n\nThe data is from 2020/02/04's TidyTuesday. Here's the [link](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-04/readme.md#get-the-data-here) to the data. @noauthor_nfl_nodate\n\n## Data Dictionary\n\nThe data dictionary can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-04/readme.md#data-dictionary).\n\n::: {.callout-warning title=\"Team Name Change\"}\nSince the data is from 2020, the now Washington Commanders are listed as Washington Redskins. The team changed its name in 2020 after complaints \"Redskins\" was offensive to Native Americans. @belson_washington_2020\n:::\n\n## Analysis\n\n![Fun facts about the Super Bowl! <br> Picture source: Britannica](superbowl.webp)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nattendance_joined <- attendance %>%\n  left_join(standings,\n    by = c(\"year\", \"team_name\", \"team\")\n  )\n\nattendance_joined %>%\n  distinct(team_name, year, margin_of_victory, playoffs) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(margin_of_victory, fill = playoffs)) +\n  geom_histogram(position = \"identity\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Margin of victory\",\n    y = \"Number of teams\",\n    fill = NULL,\n    title = \"Distribution of Margin of Victory and Playoff Status\",\n    subtitle = \"Teams that made into the playoff most likely have margin of victory larger than 0.\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 1: Histogram showing teams' margin of victory and their playoff status.](analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: column-margin\nIn the past 20 seasons, the team with the lowest margin of victory who made into the playoffs is the 2011 Denver Broncos (-5.1) .\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(standings, aes(as.factor(year), \n                      margin_of_victory))+\n  geom_point(color = \"Gray80\",\n             alpha = .7) + \n  geom_boxplot(fill = NA, \n               outlier.color = NA,\n               color = \"Gray70\",\n               alpha = .7) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"inferno\") +\n  guides(color = FALSE) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(as.factor(year),\n                               margin_of_victory,\n                               label = team_name),\n                           data = standings %>% \n                             filter(sb_winner == \"Won Superbowl\") %>% \n                             group_by(team_name) %>% \n                             slice(which.min(margin_of_victory)),\n                           hjust = -.75,\n                           nudge_x = .75,\n                           nudge_y = 5,\n                           direction = \"both\") +\n  geom_point(data = standings %>% \n               filter(sb_winner == \"Won Superbowl\"),\n             aes(color = team_name),\n             size = 1.3) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#fffff8\",\n                                        color = \"#fffff8\"),\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Season margin of victory\",\n       title = \"Do Super Bowl Winners Always Have Large Margin of Victory\",\n       subtitle = \"The 2011 Super Bowl winner has the lowest margins \\nof victory among Superbowl winners in the past 20 seasons\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 2: Boxplot showing the relative position of the Super Bowl champion's margin of victory among all teams for the past 20 seasons.](analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"The 2007 Season\"}\nYou might have noticed that in the 2007 season, there's a team with a margin of victory of almost 20 points (highest over the past 20 seasons for any team) but did not win the Super Bowl.

We can also see that it is very rare for teams who have a negative margin of victory to make it to the playoffs. Figure 2 suggests that most Super Bowl winners actually are not the team with the highest margin of victory that year, but it's also rare to have team with lower-than-median margin of victory to win the Super Bowl. The attendance record shown in Figure 3 indicates that the attendance is not obviously affected by the teams' performances in a season. Fans are more loyal than we expected! Nonetheless, the analysis regarding margin of victory did not take into account strength of schedule, which is shown to affect margin of victory. @johnson_study_2020\n\n## Functions\n\ndplyr: filter, left_join, mutate, group, select\n\nggplot2: geom_histogram, geom_point, geom_boxplot, geom_segment, facet_wrap\n\n",
